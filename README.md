# REHBER
This Directory Project is a comprehensive effort that leverages my technical skills and experience in developing a directory application where personal information is stored and managed. I provided a dynamic and seamless user experience through React component structures using data from JSON Server and db.json
It includes the feature of adding new contacts, updating and deleting contacts in the Contacts Project.
It has a user-friendly responsive design.
